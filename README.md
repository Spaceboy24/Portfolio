# Hi there, you're AWESOME! :)

Hi, I am Rachit Singhvi, an aspiring roboticist, avid rock climber and future vanlife nomad. I love all things that fly and I am super passionate about aerial robotics. I take pleasure in problem solving (*anything from a broken car to your little nephews math homework*), any sort of collaboration (*building a spaceship to modeling for your new hat brand*) and LOVE teaching people how to climb (*trust me you don't need to be able to do a pull up and you're not afraid of heights*).
