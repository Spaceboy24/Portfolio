# Hi there

Hi, I am Rachit Singhvi, an aerospace engineer üöÄ, aspiring roboticist ü§ñ, avid rock climber ‚õ∞Ô∏è and future vanlife nomad üöô. I love all things that fly and I am super passionate about aerial robotics. I take pleasure in problem solving (*anything from a broken car to your little nephews math homework*), any sort of collaboration (*building a spaceship to modeling for your new hat brand*) and LOVE teaching people how to climb (*trust me you don't need to be able to do a pull up and you're not afraid of heights*).

Here is a quick glimpse of some projects that I have worked on and that have built me into the researcher, student and human I am. Thanks for taking the time to go through them!
