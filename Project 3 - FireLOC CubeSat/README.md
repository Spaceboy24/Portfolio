# Fire Location Observation and Classification CubeSat Constellation

## State-of-the-art satellite mission planning, design and execution

The mission objective was to design and propose a constellation of 1U cubesats to locate, observe and classify ground-based wildfires. The FireLOC constellation was designed to provide 95% landmass coverage between 70S and 70N lines of latitude with a revisit period well below 24 hours.

As the attitude determination and control systems lead, I was responsible for designing the ADCS based on pointing requirements, orbital parameters and payload restrictions and analysing the precision and accuracy provided by the designed system.

In the grand scheme of things, the goal of this project was to develop skills to work as a part of a team, build organization and scheduling skills, as well as learn the industry standard in designing, proposing and presenting such missions to prepare the students for the industry.
