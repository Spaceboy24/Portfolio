## UAV Design, Build and Fly

The goal of this project was to design, build and fly a transportable, hand launched mini-UAV. The mission objective of the MUAV was to carry a payload consisting of a camera and video transmitter for mapping. 

During the course of this project, my team and I implemented state-of-the-art design processes using Siemens NX10.0 (CAD) and XFLR5 (Analysis) and manufacturing techniques such as CNC machining, 3D-printing and laser cutting to build the UAV. 

The specific design objectives are listed in the table below with an attributed level of importance for each objective:

| Design Objective    | Level of Importance |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Medium to High AR   |                    2|
| Hand launched       |                    1|
| Grass Recovery      |                    1|
| Max Altitude 400ft  |                    1|
| Slow flight (loiter)|                    1|
| High rate of climb  |                    1|
| Weight < 5lbs       |                    1|
| Flight time 20-25 m |                    2|
| Tailless aircraft   |                    3|
| Wingspan < 120"     |                    2|
