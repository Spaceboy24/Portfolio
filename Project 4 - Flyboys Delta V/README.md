# Flyboys Delta V

## UAV Design, Build and Fly

The goal of this project was to design, build and fly a transportable, hand launched mini-UAV. The mission objective of the MUAV was to carry a payload consisting of a camera and video transmitter for mapping. 

During the course of this project, my team and I implemented state-of-the-art design processes using Siemens NX10.0 (CAD) and XFLR5 (Analysis) and manufacturing techniques such as CNC machining, 3D-printing and laser cutting to build the UAV.
